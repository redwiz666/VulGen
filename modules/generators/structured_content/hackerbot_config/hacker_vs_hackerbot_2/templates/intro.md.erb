# Hacker vs Hackerbot 2

## Troubleshooting with oVirt during the test

In the unlikely event you experience technical issues with our infrastructure during the test, which you believe to be outside your control, let us know before you leave the room. However, keep in mind we won't give hints for the actual test challenges.

## Getting started
### VMs in this test

==Start these VMs== (if you haven't already):

- hackerbot_server (leave it running, you don't log into this)
- ids_server (IP address: <%= $ids_server_ip %>)
- web_server (IP address: <%= $web_server_ip %>)
- compromised_server (IP address: <%= $compromised_server_ip %>)
- desktop

All of these VMs need to be running to complete the test.

### Your login details for the "desktop" and server VMs
User: <%= $main_user %>
Password: <%= $main_password %>

You won't login to the hackerbot_server, but all the VMs need to be running to complete the lab.

### For marks in the module
1. **You need to submit flags**. Note that the flags and the challenges in your VMs are different to other's in the class. Flags will be revealed to you as you complete challenges throughout the module. Flags look like this: ==flag{*somethingrandom*}==. Follow the link on the module page to submit your flags.

## Hackerbot!

This exercise involves interacting with Hackerbot, a chatbot who will task you to complete tasks and will attack your systems. If you satisfy Hackerbot by completing the challenges, she will reveal flags to you.

Some commands you may find useful include:
* `rsync`
* `chattr`
* `lsattr`
* `chmod`
* `hashdeep`
* `shasum`
* `mount`
* `umount`
* `diff`
* `tcpdump`
* `wireshark`
* `kdesudo`
* `ssh`
* `snort`
* `sudo service snort stop`
* `sudo service snort start`
* `netstat`
* `ps`
* `lsof`
* `top`

Remember you can learn more about the commands by running:
```bash
man *command*
```

## Getting Snort up and running

**On the ids_snoop VM:**

==Ensure Snort's output== includes something more readable:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/snort/snort.conf
```
> (Remember: editing using vi involves pressing "i" to insert/edit text, then *Esc*,

> ":wq" to write changes and quit)

==Check for the following line:==
`output alert_fast`

==Ensure Snort's interface is correctly configured== to the interface with IP address <%= $ids_server_ip %> (likely ens3), and set the local network to your IP address range (or "any"):

```bash
sudo vi /etc/snort/snort.debian.conf
```
> If you are not sure which interface to use, list the interfaces with `ifconfig` or `ip a s`
> Set the interface and HOME network range, and exit vi (Esc, ":wq").

==Restart Snort:==

```bash
sudo service snort stop
sudo service snort start
```
> Using "reload" or "restart" may not update the interface.

Snort should now be running, monitoring network traffic for activity.

### Good luck!
